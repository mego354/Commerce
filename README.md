# CS50â€™s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - Project 2: Commerce

## Project Description
This project involves creating an eBay-like e-commerce auction site using Django. The site allows users to:
- Post auction listings
- Place bids on listings
- Comment on listings
- Add listings to a watchlist

The distribution code includes a Django project named `commerce`, which contains a single app called `auctions`.

## Features

### Models
Your application should have at least three models in addition to the User model:
1. **Auction Listings**: To store details about each auction.
2. **Bids**: To store information about bids placed on listings.
3. **Comments**: To store comments made on auction listings.

### Create Listing
Users can create a new listing with the following details:
- Title
- Description
- Starting bid
- Optional: Image URL
- Optional: Category (e.g., Fashion, Toys, Electronics, Home, etc.)

### Active Listings Page
The default route displays all currently active auction listings, showing:
- Title
- Description
- Current price
- Photo (if available)

### Listing Page
A detailed view of a listing with the following features:
- View listing details including the current price
- Add/remove the item to/from the watchlist (if signed in)
- Place a bid on the item (if signed in)
- Close the auction (if the user created the listing and is signed in)
- Display auction winner information (if applicable and signed in)
- Add comments to the listing (if signed in)
- Display all comments made on the listing

### Watchlist
A page for signed-in users to view all listings they have added to their watchlist, with links to each listing's detailed page.

### Categories
A page displaying all listing categories. Clicking on a category shows all active listings within that category.

### Django Admin Interface
Site administrators can:
- View, add, edit, and delete any listings, comments, and bids through the Django admin interface.

## Setup Instructions

### URL Configuration
- Defined in `auctions/urls.py`
- Predefined routes: default index, `/login`, `/logout`, and `/register`

### Views
- Defined in `auctions/views.py`
- Predefined views: `index`, `login_view`, `logout_view`, and `register`

### Running the Application
1. Start the Django web server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```
2. Open your browser and visit the site.
3. Register for an account and observe the HTML changes based on the authentication status.

### Modifying HTML Layout
- HTML layout is in `auctions/templates/auctions/layout.html`
- Modify this file to change the layout, especially content wrapped in `user.is_authenticated` checks.

### Defining Models
- Define additional models in `auctions/models.py`
- Run migrations after changes:
  ```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
  ```
